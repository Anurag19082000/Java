package is important , all the class should lie in that package ;

then main method is neccasary

git commands
Cool 👍 since you’ve already cloned the repo and made local changes, pushing is just a few clean steps. I’ll keep this practical + interview-safe.

1️⃣ Check what you changed
git status


You’ll see something like:

modified:   src/Main.java

2️⃣ Add changes to staging

To add all changed files:

git add .


Or a specific file:

git add src/Main.java

3️⃣ Commit your changes
git commit -m "Implemented animal interface and pig class"


👉 Message should be short + meaningful

4️⃣ Push to remote repository
git push origin main


If your branch is master:

git push origin master
